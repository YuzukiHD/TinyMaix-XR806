 *
 * This file defines the cryptographic functions that need to be implemented
 * for wpa_supplicant and hostapd. When TLS is not used, internal
 * implementation of MD5, SHA1, and AES is used and no external libraries are
 * required. When TLS is enabled (e.g., by enabling EAP-TLS or EAP-PEAP), the
 * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
 * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these
 * functions twice.
 *
 * Wrapper code for using each crypto library is in its own file (crypto*.c)
 * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions
 * defined here.
